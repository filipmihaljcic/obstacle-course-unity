# Obstacle Course Game 

This project shows some basic obstacle course game. It's nothing fancy; just a plane with obstacles built out of Unity primitives.
Also project uses fairly basic scripting for dropping obstacles, spinninig obstacles etc. There is also collision system that is 
used for detecting when player finish a level and Unity Scene Managment for loading levels. Project is far from done; it's just a 
prototype and can be expanded further.
